# Requirements Document: Flow Steps Optimization

## Introduction

This feature aims to optimize and simplify the `/flow/steps/` components and Redux state management in the resume-oracle-ui project. The goal is to reduce code complexity, eliminate duplication, and accelerate feature development while maintaining application stability. The optimization focuses on three key areas: step components, Redux state management, and TypeScript type standardization.

## Requirements

### 1. Step Component Structure Simplification

**User Story**: As a developer, I want simplified and reusable step components so that I can quickly understand, maintain, and extend the multi-step workflow functionality.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
1. **WHEN** a developer examines any step component **THEN** the component SHALL follow a consistent architectural pattern with clear separation of concerns
2. **WHEN** step components are created **THEN** they SHALL utilize a standardized base component or hook to reduce boilerplate code
3. **WHEN** similar functionality exists across multiple steps **THEN** it SHALL be extracted into shared components or utilities
4. **WHEN** step components handle state **THEN** they SHALL use consistent patterns for local vs global state management
5. **WHEN** step components interact with services **THEN** they SHALL use standardized service integration patterns

### 2. Code Duplication Elimination

**User Story**: As a developer, I want to eliminate code duplication across step components so that I can maintain a single source of truth and reduce maintenance overhead.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
1. **WHEN** common UI patterns exist (action bars, modals, cards) **THEN** they SHALL be extracted into reusable components
2. **WHEN** similar data transformation logic exists **THEN** it SHALL be consolidated into shared utility functions
3. **WHEN** step components handle file operations **THEN** they SHALL use common file handling utilities
4. **WHEN** step components display loading/error states **THEN** they SHALL use standardized loading and error handling components
5. **WHEN** step components perform validation **THEN** they SHALL use shared validation schemas and patterns

### 3. Redux State Management Optimization

**User Story**: As a developer, I want simplified Redux state management patterns so that I can easily understand state flow and implement new features with consistent patterns.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
1. **WHEN** Redux slices are examined **THEN** they SHALL follow consistent naming conventions and structure patterns
2. **WHEN** state updates occur **THEN** they SHALL use standardized action patterns and payload structures
3. **WHEN** async operations are performed **THEN** they SHALL use consistent async handling patterns (RTK Query or unified async slice patterns)
4. **WHEN** related state exists across multiple slices **THEN** it SHALL be consolidated where appropriate to reduce cross-slice dependencies
5. **WHEN** selectors are needed **THEN** they SHALL be defined using consistent patterns and exported from slice files

### 4. TypeScript Type Standardization

**User Story**: As a developer, I want consistent TypeScript type definitions so that I can easily understand data structures and avoid type-related errors during development.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
1. **WHEN** data models are defined **THEN** they SHALL use either Zod schemas OR TypeScript interfaces consistently, not both for the same data
2. **WHEN** Zod schemas exist **THEN** TypeScript types SHALL be derived from them using `z.infer<>`
3. **WHEN** component props are defined **THEN** they SHALL use consistent interface naming conventions (ComponentNameProps)
4. **WHEN** API responses are typed **THEN** they SHALL use validated schemas that match service expectations
5. **WHEN** Redux state is typed **THEN** it SHALL use consistent typing patterns across all slices

### 5. Component Hierarchy Simplification

**User Story**: As a developer, I want simplified component hierarchies so that I can easily understand component relationships and data flow.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
1. **WHEN** complex components exist **THEN** they SHALL be broken down into smaller, focused components with clear responsibilities
2. **WHEN** prop drilling occurs **THEN** it SHALL be eliminated through proper state management or context usage
3. **WHEN** components have multiple responsibilities **THEN** they SHALL be split using container/presentational patterns
4. **WHEN** shared functionality exists **THEN** it SHALL be extracted into custom hooks or utility functions
5. **WHEN** component composition is needed **THEN** it SHALL use compound component patterns where appropriate

### 6. Service Integration Standardization

**User Story**: As a developer, I want standardized service integration patterns so that I can consistently integrate LLM services and handle their responses.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
1. **WHEN** LLM services are called **THEN** they SHALL use the unified `useLlmService` hook pattern
2. **WHEN** service responses are processed **THEN** they SHALL use consistent error handling and loading state management
3. **WHEN** service calls are made **THEN** they SHALL use validated input/output schemas from the zodModels
4. **WHEN** service state is managed **THEN** it SHALL follow consistent patterns for caching and invalidation
5. **WHEN** multiple services are composed **THEN** they SHALL use standardized composition patterns

### 7. Development Experience Improvements

**User Story**: As a developer, I want improved development experience so that I can implement new features faster with fewer bugs.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
1. **WHEN** new step components are created **THEN** they SHALL follow documented patterns and templates
2. **WHEN** debugging is needed **THEN** consistent logging and error reporting patterns SHALL be available
3. **WHEN** testing is performed **THEN** components SHALL be easily testable with minimal mocking requirements
4. **WHEN** code review is performed **THEN** consistent patterns SHALL make reviews faster and more focused
5. **WHEN** refactoring is needed **THEN** modular design SHALL enable safe incremental changes

### 8. Performance and Stability

**User Story**: As a user, I want the application to remain stable and performant so that the optimization doesn't break existing functionality.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
1. **WHEN** components are refactored **THEN** all existing functionality SHALL remain intact
2. **WHEN** state management is optimized **THEN** application performance SHALL be maintained or improved
3. **WHEN** TypeScript types are standardized **THEN** compile-time safety SHALL be maintained or improved
4. **WHEN** components are simplified **THEN** runtime performance SHALL not degrade
5. **WHEN** the optimization is complete **THEN** the application SHALL pass all existing functional tests

### 9. Migration and Compatibility

**User Story**: As a developer, I want clean migration to optimized patterns so that I can implement comprehensive improvements without legacy constraints.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
1. **WHEN** existing components are refactored **THEN** they SHALL be completely restructured to follow new patterns without backward compatibility requirements
2. **WHEN** new patterns are introduced **THEN** they SHALL replace old patterns entirely for maximum optimization benefits
3. **WHEN** state structure changes **THEN** current state data CAN be discarded as no data persistence is required
4. **WHEN** internal API contracts change **THEN** they SHALL be freely modified since all services are internal LLM integrations with no external API dependencies
5. **WHEN** TypeScript types change **THEN** they SHALL be completely restructured EXCEPT for Zod models used in LLM service prompt output schemas which SHALL remain unchanged

### 10. Documentation and Maintainability

**User Story**: As a developer, I want clear documentation of optimized patterns so that I can follow consistent practices for future development.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
1. **WHEN** new patterns are established **THEN** they SHALL be documented with examples and usage guidelines
2. **WHEN** architectural decisions are made **THEN** they SHALL be documented with rationale and trade-offs
3. **WHEN** component templates are created **THEN** they SHALL include usage examples and best practices
4. **WHEN** state management patterns are standardized **THEN** they SHALL include migration guides and examples
5. **WHEN** type definitions are consolidated **THEN** they SHALL include inline documentation and usage examples
