## 1. Pain Points Addressed

1. **Job Description–Centered Tailoring**  
   Conventional solutions focus on reshaping the resume itself. Resume Oracle inverts the approach: you paste the **job description** and optional company context first, then optimize your resume to those explicit requirements.

2. **Inaccurate AI Edits**  
   General-purpose AI chatbots can invent skills or experiences a candidate doesn’t have. Resume Oracle strictly uses the user’s own text as the source, ensuring no fictional content is introduced.

3. **No Context Retention Across Steps**  
   Traditional AI workflows lose track of your previously accepted skills or sections, forcing you to re‑enter or remind the AI in each step. Resume Oracle maintains a persistent memory of your profile sections and refinements throughout the entire process, so you never lose progress or repeat yourself.

4. **Repetitive Copy‑Paste**  
   Many tools require multiple rounds of copy‑pasting into different fields. Our single‑step import captures all of your existing experience at once, reducing friction.

5. **Local Data Processing & Privacy**  
   Other platforms force structured form inputs, mandatory sign‑ups, and cloud data processing. Resume Oracle processes all data locally in your browser with configurable LLM providers, offering a **plain Markdown export** in a clean, minimal layout optimized for applicant‑tracking systems (ATS).

6. **Lack of Cultural Fit Considerations**  
   Few tools incorporate company values or cultural cues. Resume Oracle allows you to paste company mission statements or culture descriptions so your resume can highlight appropriate soft skills.
