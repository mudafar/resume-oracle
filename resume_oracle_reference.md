# Resume Oracle - Complete Product Reference

## Product Overview

Resume Oracle is an open-source, privacy-first AI-powered resume optimization tool that helps job seekers discover hidden skills and create targeted resumes. Unlike traditional resume builders or AI chat tools, Resume Oracle uses a sophisticated workflow to analyze job descriptions, match them with your experience, and guide you through creating optimized resumes without hallucination or data loss.

**Current Status**: v0.1 Initial Public Alpha Release

## Core Value Propositions

### Primary Value Proposition
**"Discover Skills You Forgot You Had"**

### Key Differentiators

- Reveals hidden/implicit requirements from job descriptions
- Goes beyond surface-level keyword matching

#### 3. Progressive Profile Building
- Your profile becomes smarter with each job application
- Context never lost between sessions
- Reduces time investment for subsequent applications

#### 4. No Hallucination Promise
- Only suggests experiences you actually have
- Never invents fake qualifications or skills
- Maintains accuracy through structured workflow

#### 5. Coach-Style Guidance
- Step-by-step workflow instead of one-shot generation
- You drive the process, AI provides suggestions
- Guided gap filling rather than automated generation
